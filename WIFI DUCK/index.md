# Wifi Duck

A WiFiDuck is a hardware tool designed for wireless keyboard injection attacks, inspired by the well-known USB Rubber Ducky. Essentially, it allows you to control a device remotely by emulating a USB keyboard, meaning you can send keystrokes wirelessly to a target computer. This is often used for ethical hacking, penetration testing, or educational purposes to demonstrate how vulnerable a machine can be to input injection attacks.


## Features

What it can do (practical capabilities)
	â€¢	Simulate human typing (HID) â€” run any sequence of keystrokes a user could type (open terminals, launch apps, navigate menus).
	â€¢	Execute scripts remotely â€” you control it over Wi-Fi (web UI) so you can push/execute scripts on the fly.
	â€¢	Automate setup tasks â€” legitimate uses: provisioning machines, automated testing, or demos where you need to type repetitive sequences.
	â€¢	Quick demo / training tool â€” great for safe phishing / social-engineering demonstrations in red team exercises.
	â€¢	Exfiltrate text â€” typed text can copy clipboard contents or type out files to a remote terminal when combined with network operations.
	â€¢	Flexible payloads â€” can run anything keyboard input can achieve (from benign status messages to launching a PowerShell/terminal and issuing commands).
  â€¢	Cross-Platform â€” Works on any system that accepts keyboard input, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
